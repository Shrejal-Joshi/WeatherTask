# weather-News

Run : npm start (localhost : 5000)
Used Library & Db = MongoDB atlas cluster, JSON Webtoken, News API NPM, Open WeatherApp-Node NPM, express


Not changing the API KEY and APP ID which is used in News Api and openweather-node 
Also not keeping the mongodb connection url as private
Project can simply run after cloning 
And I am also sharing the video of all API's how video how it is working
